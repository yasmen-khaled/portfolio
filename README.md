# 3D Portfolio Showcase

![Image Description](file:///C:/Users/issa/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot%202024-07-15%20195354.png)

Welcome to my 3D Portfolio Showcase! This project is designed to display my professional journey through an interactive 3D environment, leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Three.js, React, TypeScript, and Blender for object modeling. The goal is to provide a unique and engaging way to explore my skills, experiences, and projects.

## Technologies Used

- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**: A cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics on a Web browser.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive UI.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions.
- **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)**: An open-source 3D creation suite that supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, motion tracking, and video editing.
